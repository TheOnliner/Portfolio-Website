                                <p><i>“Man often becomes what he believes himself to be. If I keep on saying to myself that I cannot do a certain thing, it is possible that I may end by really becoming incapable of doing it. On the contrary, if I have the belief that I can do it, I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.”</i></p>

                                    Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls;
                                    Where words come out from the depth of truth;
                                    Where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection;
                                    Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit;
                                    Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action -
                                    Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.”</i></p>

                                <p><i>“Desire, when it stems from the heart and spirit, when it is pure and intense, possesses awesome electromagnetic energy. This energy is released into the ether each night, as the mind falls into the sleep state. Each morning it returns to the conscious state reinforced with the cosmic currents. That which has been imaged will surely and certainly be manifested. You can rely, young man, upon this ageless promise as surely as you can rely upon the eternally unbroken promise of sunrise... and of Spring.”</i></p>
